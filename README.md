## Generating Intermediate Data

## Simulated datasets

### Motion estimation results

If you want to reproduce the motion estimation results.

### Spike sorting results

If you want to reproduce the spike sorting results.

### Running motion estimation

To run the motion estimation methods.

### Running spike sorting

To run spike sorting.

### Generating simulated datasets

If you would like to run spike sorting on the simulated datasets, then you will
need the raw simulated datasets themselves. Due to the prohibitively large total
size of the simulated datasets (~23Tb), we have not open-sourced them. However,
you may generate these datasets.
